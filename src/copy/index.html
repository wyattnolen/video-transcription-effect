		<span data-timing="7.14"> but I don’t want to be an emperor.</span>
		<span data-timing="9.12"> That’s not my business.</span>

		<span data-timing="19.15"> We all want to help one another.</span>
		<span data-timing="21.06"> Human beings are like that.</span>
		<span data-timing="23.05"> We want to live by each other’s happiness</span>
		<span data-timing="24.14"> - not by each other’s misery. </span>
		<span data-timing="26.12"> We don’t want to hate and despise one another.</span>
		<span data-timing="29.01"> In this world there is room for everyone.</span>
		<span data-timing="30.16"> And the good earth is rich</span>
		<span data-timing="32.08"> and can provide for everyone.</span>
		<span data-timing="34.09"> The way of life can be free</span>
		<span data-timing="35.18"> and beautiful,</span>
		<span data-timing="37.08"> but we have lost the way.</span>

		Greed has poisoned men’s souls, has barricaded the world with hate, has goose-stepped us into misery and
		bloodshed. We have developed speed, but we have shut ourselves in. Machinery that gives abundance has
		left us in
		want. Our knowledge has made us cynical. Our cleverness, hard and unkind. We think too much and feel too
		little.
		More than machinery we need humanity. More than cleverness we need kindness and gentleness. Without
		these
		qualities, life will be violent and all will be lost….

		The aeroplane and the radio have brought us closer together. The very nature of these inventions cries
		out for
		the goodness in men - cries out for universal brotherhood - for the unity of us all. Even now my voice
		is
		reaching millions throughout the world - millions of despairing men, women, and little children -
		victims of a
		system that makes men torture and imprison innocent people.


		To those who can hear me, I say - do not despair. The misery that is now upon us is but the passing of
		greed -
		the bitterness of men who fear the way of human progress. The hate of men will pass, and dictators die,
		and the
		power they took from the people will return to the people. And so long as men die, liberty will never
		perish.
		…..

		Soldiers! don’t give yourselves to brutes - men who despise you - enslave you - who regiment your lives
		- tell
		you what to do - what to think and what to feel! Who drill you - diet you - treat you like cattle, use
		you as
		cannon fodder. Don’t give yourselves to these unnatural men - machine men with machine minds and machine
		hearts!
		You are not machines! You are not cattle! You are men! You have the love of humanity in your hearts! You
		don’t
		hate! Only the unloved hate - the unloved and the unnatural! Soldiers! Don’t fight for slavery! Fight
		for
		liberty!

		In the 17th Chapter of St Luke it is written: “the Kingdom of God is within man” - not one man nor a
		group of
		men, but in all men! In you! You, the people have the power - the power to create machines. The power to
		create
		happiness! You, the people, have the power to make this life free and beautiful, to make this life a
		wonderful
		adventure.

		Then - in the name of democracy - let us use that power - let us all unite. Let us fight for a new world
		- a
		decent world that will give men a chance to work - that will give youth a future and old age a security.
		By the
		promise of these things, brutes have risen to power. But they lie! They do not fulfil that promise. They
		never
		will!

		Dictators free themselves but they enslave the people! Now let us fight to fulfil that promise! Let us
		fight to
		free the world - to do away with national barriers - to do away with greed, with hate and intolerance.
		Let us
		fight for a world of reason, a world where science and progress will lead to all men’s happiness.
		Soldiers! in
		the name of democracy, let us all unite!
